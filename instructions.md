In order to build **grids** (rows and columns), it was needed to install
[react-grid-system](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-grid-system). The
tutorial is found in [link](https://jsxmachina.github.io/react-grid-system/).

In order to build **tabs** and other stuff, I tried installing
[Pivotal UI](https://styleguide.pivotal.io/getstarted).
This can also manage **grids**. I had problems with TABS ¬¬, but I liked
the way it manage **grids**.

I tried with [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/), which didn't work
either.

I had to try with [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/).
Example works well. I had to add this lines in the .html file:

  <!-- Latest compiled and minified CSS -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/latest/css/bootstrap.min.css">

  <!-- Optional theme -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/latest/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css">

In order to manage files tree, I tried
[npm i react-folder-tree](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-folder-tree).


Para crear el DataTables en React creamos un Componente y fue necesario cargar el jquery y el datatables.net.
